## Brainstorming 

* Definitely going with symbolism from the Pagan tradition since PEGN is
  a pagan extension of Bryan Ford's original PEG example from his paper.

* Inclined to use Triskele since it symbolizes three things coming
  together equally which matches the combination of PEG, ABNF, and JSON.

  * PEG should be an inspirational, foundational color (like saffron).
  * ABNF should be an obscure but powerful color (maybe teal).
  * JSON should be a ubiquitous color.

* Disinclined to add any letter at all, but very into picking the right
  colors, perhaps a different color for each arm.
